# FIESTA PIÃ‘ATA

A satirical Shoot 'Em Up for the stm32f7

## Setup

1. install stlink
    * arch: `sudo pacman -S stlink`
    * general linux
        * install `libusb-dev` 1.0
        * install `cmake`
        * install a C-Compiler (sorry)
        * `git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink.git && cd stlink && make release && cd build/Release && sudo make install`
    * mac os: `brew install stlink`
    * windows: unzip `stlink-1.3.1-win32.zip`
2. install arm cross compilers
    * arch: `sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-gdb`
    * debian/ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi gdb-arm-none-eabi`
    * macOS: `brew tap osx-cross/arm && brew install arm-gcc-bin`
        * if you get problems with gdb try `brew install Caskroom/cask/gcc-arm-embedded`
    * windows:
        * download `GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain` from https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
        * execute to install
        * ensure installation path is added to 'PATH' variable (might require a reboot)
3. install a nightly compiler
    * version of 2017-03-28 is working. To use that version append `-2017-03-28` to `nightly` everywhere
    * `rustup update nightly` (or `rustup update nightly-2017-03-28`)
4. dowload the rust source code
    * if your rustup does not have the `component` subcommand: `rustup self update`
    * `rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly`
5. install `xargo`
    * `cargo +nightly install xargo`
    * NOTE: do **not** run this command in this folder, you will get errors about the compiler not finding the standard library
6. get the demo code
    * `git clone https://github.com/Rust-Mikrocontroller-Praktikum-2017/megamaertz.git`

## Compiling

1. `cd megamaertz`
2. `rustup override set nightly`
3. `xargo build --release`
4. have patience, the first time you run `xargo build`, the `core` library and various others need to be built.
5. open another terminal and run `st-util` (win: `st-util.exe` is located in `stlink-1.3.1-win32\bin`, which was unzipped for setup)
6. go back to your first terminal
7. run `sh gdb_release.sh` (for windows you need to adapt this)
